# 🐾 Meovis – Understand Your ML Models, Visually

**Meovis** is an open-source tool that helps you visualize, explain, and compare your machine learning models with clarity — wrapped in a sleek, mascot-powered interface.

Let your models speak. **Meovis** makes it understandable.

## 🎯 What is Meovis?

Meovis is an interactive visual assistant for:

- ✅ Visualizing classification performance (Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall)  
- ✅ Explaining model predictions with SHAP (feature importances, contributions)  
- ✅ Comparing multiple models side-by-side  
- ✅ Presenting your ML outputs to non-technical stakeholders in a meaningful way  

All of this, with a dash of charm and the curiosity of our mascot — **Meovis the catbot** 🐱📊

## 🚀 Technology Stack

### Backend Technologies

1. **FastAPI** (Python Web Framework)  
   RESTful API development, model loading, and prediction endpoints with automatic docs and async support.

2. **Core ML Libraries**  
   - `scikit-learn`: Model loading, metrics, feature importance  
   - `joblib`: Secure model file loading  
   - `pandas` & `numpy`: Data manipulation and numeric operations  

3. **Explainability Libraries**  
   - `SHAP`, `LIME`, `eli5` for model interpretation  

4. **Visualization & Metrics**  
   - `plotly`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn.metrics`  

5. **Data Management & Validation**  
   - `SQLAlchemy` + `SQLite` for temporary data  
   - `Pydantic` for data validation  

### Frontend Technologies

- React + TypeScript for responsive UI  
- Plotly.js, Recharts, D3.js for rich visualizations  
- Material-UI or Ant Design, Tailwind CSS for styling  
- React Dropzone for file uploads  
- React Query / Zustand for state management  

### DevOps & Deployment

- Docker and Docker Compose  
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD  
- Deployments on Heroku, Vercel, Railway, or Render  
- Testing with pytest, Jest, Playwright/Cypress
